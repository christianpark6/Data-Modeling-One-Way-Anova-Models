# Data-Modeling-One-Way-Anova-Models
In this Repository I have included my R Script looking at multiple data sets and creating One-Way Anova Models in order to find statistical signifance among categorical predictors. The problems and datasets came from Textbook: Cannon, A. R. et al (2019). STAT2: Modeling with Regression and ANOVA, Se. Through this homework I created and analyzed the models, visualizations, descriptive statistics, as well as the honest significanct difference.
